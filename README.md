# DL-Project
My first deep learning project.

Game Plan
#1 collect data
#2 figure out how to load data into python and process it so that a DL model can use it as input
#3 build learning model with keras
#4 train-test
#5 deploy model to an app

#1 Data Collection
	- dogs vs cats(classification)
	- MNIST(classification)
	- stock data
		- historical prices(regression)
	- sports data
		- local league stats
		- for world cup

#3 Building Learning Models
	- Multi-layer perceptron for MNIST and dogs vs cats

	- Convolutional network for MNIST and dogs vs cats
	
	- LSTM network for stocks
